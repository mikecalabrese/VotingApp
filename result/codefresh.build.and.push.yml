steps:

  build_image:
    title: Building Voting Image
    type: build
    #Important: rename this image to to a valid repository in your registry. For example: myUserName/result
    image_name: containers101/result
    #The directory should be relative to git repository that is used for cloning
    working_directory: ./result/
    #Dockerfile location should be relative to the working directory
    dockerfile: Dockerfile

  push_to_registry:
    title: Pushing to Docker Registry Test
    type: push

    #A candidate is the image that we want to push to registry
    candidate: '${{build_image}}'

    # You can push the image with whatever tag you want. In our example we use CF_BRANCH, which is a variable in
    # the build process, accessible throughout the entire flow.
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH}}'

    #push only if the commit message contains the word '[promote]'. This is just an example of a custom rule.
    #Check https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/conditional-execution-of-steps to see more examples of conditions
